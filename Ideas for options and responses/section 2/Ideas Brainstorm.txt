You stepped out into the bright light:
  you cant see
    focus
    look for something
      you cant see you dipshit
    explore
      probably not a good idea as you cant see
      explore
        fine then
          you died and you couldn't see why you jackwagon
    the landscape is covered in a thin blanket of snow
      eat the snow
        ...uh you eat the snow, you feel slightly dehydrated
      explore
        you look around, you apparently exited out a cabin, there is a tree house in the distance
          go forward
            you walk awhile and nothing seems to change until you get to a lake, the lake seems to be more black then it should be
              touch it
                it feels like oil
              drink it
                ...it tastes like oil
              bath in it
                YOU SMELL LIKE OIL
              walk around it
                you walk around it and stumble onto another cabin, or is it the same cabin? you dont thing you made a circle but sure it is thats the same cabin
          go left
            you walk a short distance and you stumble on a metal door attached to a concrete wall, the wall seems to phase into the sorounding hill
              inspect
                the door has a strange symbol on it and there seems to be a keypad with a red and green botton next to the door
                  look closer at symbol
                    the door seems to be a circle within a circle and the outer circle has three arrows equally placed and going inwards
                  press green botton
                    the door promptly opens
                      walk inside
                        you walk inside, to section 3
                      go back
                        you go back to the cabin
                  press red botton
                    it makes a beep noise as if it says denied
              open door
                there is not a handle
          go right
            you walk quite a distance till you find a brick wall
              inspect
                there appears to be a message on it that says, "Other Way"
                  Go the other way

                  taste it
                    taste like old pennies
                  touch it
                    its a strange sticky substince
              go back
          go to the tree house
            the ladder up seems old and some of the steps seemes to have fallen off
              go up
                one of the steps breaks and you fall
              go back
                you go back to the cabin

      look for things
        there is an axe stuck in a dead tree trunk with a pile of woods
          grab axe
            with a little effort you got the axe + 1 wood axe
          grab wood
            you picked up on of the cut logs + 1 firewood
              you probably only need one


      make snowball
        you made a snowball +1 snowball
        make snow ball +1 snowball?
          make snow ball why?
           make snow ball stop
            make snow ball
              you died from hypothermia
