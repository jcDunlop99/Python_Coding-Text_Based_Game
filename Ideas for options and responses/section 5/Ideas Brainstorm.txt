you arrive downstairs and you appear to be in a long hallway with doors all around some of the doors seems to have windows while the others are just bland doors
  go threw hallway
    you go threw the hallway being wary and staying clear of the doors
    you take tho right runs before you reach a dead end at the end of the hallway is a single blue keycard on the ground
      pick up keycard
        as soon as you pick up the keycard you hear a loud bang as if a door shut, as you turn around all of the doors in the hallway open... all types of monsters rush out of the doors and rush you, you are killed before you even know what happened
          you died
      turn around and go back
        halfway threw going back you hear a loud bang and all of the hallway doors open, you died before you even know what happened
  look at windows
    the first door seems to have a portal to some unknown place, the second viewable window is covered in some strange brownish red substance and you cant make out whats in there, the third and final door seems to have some clown in a corner as you stare at him he turns around and looks at you, you continue before he does anything you reach an wall with a single blue keycard on the ground
      pick up keycard
      turn around and go back
